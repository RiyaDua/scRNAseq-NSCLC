# Single-Cell RNA-seq Analysis of NSCLC Tumor Cells

 **Author**: Riya Dua
 **Dataset**: 20k dissociated tumor cells from NSCLC patients (10x Genomics)  
 **Tool used**: Seurat in R  
 **Goal**: Identify cellular heterogeneity and marker genes

## Objective:
To identify transcriptionally distinct subpopulations within NSCLC tumor samples using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and characterize them based on their marker gene expression.


## Repository structure:
- `NSCLC_analysis.R`: Seurat pipeline
- `data/`: Data matrix downloaded 
- `figures/`: All saved output plots
- `output/`: Marker gene tables, Seurat object (optional)

## Key Steps:
### 1. Data Import and Quality Control

After downloading the filtered gene-barcode matrix (`.h5` format) from 10x Genomics, I imported the expression data using `Read10X_h5()`, which provides a sparse matrix of raw UMI counts.

Since raw single-cell data contains a mix of high-quality, low-quality, and dying cells, I applied **quality control** filters based on:

- **Number of detected genes per cell (`nFeature_RNA`)** â€“ to remove potential empty droplets or doublets  
- **Total UMI count per cell (`nCount_RNA`)** â€“ to account for sequencing depth  
- **Percentage of mitochondrial gene expression (`percent.mt`)** â€“ high mitochondrial content often indicates stressed or dying cells  

This filtering step ensures that only high-quality, biologically relevant cells are retained for downstream analysis. After filtering, it retained **464 high-quality cells** for analysis.

### 2. Normalization and Variable Feature Detection

To ensure that technical variability (e.g., differences in sequencing depth) does not bias downstream analyses, I applied **log normalization** using `NormalizeData()`. This method scales UMI counts in each cell to a total of 10,000, followed by log-transformation.

Next, I identified the **top 2,000 most variable genes** using the `vst` method via `FindVariableFeatures()`. These genes exhibit the highest cell-to-cell variability and likely drive the biological heterogeneity present in the tumor microenvironment. Focusing on these genes improves the signal-to-noise ratio and enhances the accuracy of dimensionality reduction and clustering.

### 3. PCA and UMAP-Based Clustering

To reduce the dimensionality of the data and highlight major sources of variation, I performed **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** on the highly variable genes. This compresses the expression matrix into principal components that capture the most significant expression trends.

To determine the optimal number of PCs to use for clustering, I evaluated the **Elbow Plot**, which suggested retaining ~15 PCs.

Based on these PCs, I constructed a **Shared Nearest Neighbor (SNN) graph** using `FindNeighbors()` and then applied the **Louvain algorithm** for unsupervised clustering using `FindClusters()` at multiple resolutions. This identified **transcriptionally distinct cell clusters** representing subpopulations within the NSCLC sample.

Finally, I visualized the clusters using **UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)** â€” a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique that preserves both local and global structures in the data, making it ideal for visualizing complex scRNA-seq datasets in 2D space.

### 4. Marker Gene Identification

To characterize each cluster, I used `FindAllMarkers()` to perform **differential gene expression analysis**. This identifies genes that are significantly **upregulated in each cluster** compared to all other cells.

By filtering on adjusted p-values and minimum expression thresholds, I extracted a set of **robust marker genes** that define the identity or functional state of each cluster.

For example, clusters showed enriched expression of genes like **ITGA1**, **TRGC2**, and **LILRB4**, suggesting the presence of diverse epithelial, immune, and stromal populations within the tumor. These findings highlight the **cellular heterogeneity** of NSCLC and provide insight into potential cellular subtypes or states relevant to tumor biology.

## Analysis Pipeline

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **1. Data Loading** | Read 10x `.h5` matrix using `Read10X_h5()` |
| **2. QC Filtering** | Removed low-quality cells (<200 or >2500 genes, >5% mitochondrial content) |
| **3. Normalization** | Log normalization of raw UMI counts |
| **4. Feature Selection** | Identified top 2,000 highly variable genes |
| **5. Scaling** | Centered and scaled data, regressing out unwanted variation |
| **6. PCA** | Performed linear dimensionality reduction |
| **7. Clustering** | Constructed SNN graph and identified clusters at multiple resolutions |
| **8. UMAP** | Visualized clusters in 2D space |
